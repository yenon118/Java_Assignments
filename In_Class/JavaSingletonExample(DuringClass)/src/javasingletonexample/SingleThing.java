 * This example is based on:
 * https://sourcemaking.com/design_patterns/singleton/java/1
 * 
 * University of Maryland Computer Science researcher Bill Pugh has written 
 * about the code issues underlying the Singleton pattern when implemented 
 * in Java. Pugh's efforts on the "Double-checked locking" idiom led to 
 * changes in the Java memory model in Java 5 and to what is generally 
 * regarded as the standard method to implement Singletons in Java. 
 * The technique is known as the initialization on demand holder idiom, 
 * is as lazy as possible, and works in all known versions of Java. 
 * It takes advantage of language guarantees about class initialization, 
 * and will therefore work correctly in all Java-compliant compilers and 
 * virtual machines.
 *
 * The inner class is referenced no earlier (and therefore loaded no 
 * earlier by the class loader) than the moment that getInstance() is 
 * called. Thus, this solution is thread-safe without requiring special 
 * language constructs (i.e. volatile or synchronized).
